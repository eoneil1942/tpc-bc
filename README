TPCB and TPCC for VoltDB and CVoltDB, as of 7/23/13
Note: tpcb was written by Betty, derived from tpcc provided with Voltdb distro
  CVoltDB tpcc was written by Weiwei, derived from VoltDB tpcc

Benchmark Sources: three versions of procedures:
--with CVoltdb annotations, escrow cols (under src)
--with CVoltdb annotations but no escrow cols (under src-cv-nonescrow)
--without CVoltdb annotations (under src-v)

To run with CVoltdb server, escrow columns in DB:
Use the src directories as is, but copy to ../tpc-bc-e

To run with CVoltdb server, no escrow columns in DB:
Copy everything to ../tpc-bc-ne
Replace src/com/*procedures with src-cv-nonescrow/com/*procedures

To run with VoltDB:
Copy everything to ../tpc-bc-v
Replace src/com/*procedures with src-v/com/*procedures
If using Voltdb 3.0+, change src/com/MyTPCCLoader.java's import of org.voltdb.Pair
   to import of org.voltcore.Pair

To run with a Voltdb or CVoltdb server in dir at ../spot

To run server: single host
Single Host: uses deployment.xml
bash run_tpc[bc]1.sh spot catalog-v      for Voltdb server
or
bash run_tpc[bc]1.sh spot catalog-cv   for CVoltdb server
bash run_tpc[bc]1.sh spot server > /mnt/ramdisk/server.log   (either server)
(or use runservers1.sh, which uses /mnt/ramdisk for output)

Multihost: uses mhx_deployment.xml x= 2, 3, or 4
--Check host ids in run_tpc[bc]x.sh
bash run_tpc[bc]x.sh spot catalog-v      for Voltdb server, or CVoltdb server on no-escrow-cols DB
or
bash run_tpc[bc]x.sh spot catalog-cv     for CVoltdb server, using escrow cols in DB
bash run_tpc[bc]x.sh spot server > /mnt/ramdisk/server.log   (either server)

The running of servers on multiple hosts is automated by the runserversx.sh series
They output to /mnt/ramdisk, the ramdisk created at bootup by fstab entry
bash runserversx.sh tpc[bc] spot catalog-cv    for CVoltdb server, using escrow cols in DB, K=0
  so for example for escrow tpcb using CVoltdb in apr6 on 4 hosts, K=0:
  logon to cv2, the assumed controlling host
  cd tpc-bc-e  (copy of tpc-bc available on all 4 hosts)
  bash runservers4.sh tpcb apr6 catalog-cv    will run server on 4 hosts
  Note: don't use " > output-file" with runserversx.sh
  for asserts: bash runservers4.sh tpcb apr6 catalog-cv -ea
  
bash runserversx.sh tpc[bc] spot catalog-v    for CVoltdb server, using no escrow cols in DB, K=0
                                              or Voltdb server
For K=1 replication,
bash runserversxk1.sh tpc[bc] spot catalog-cv|catalog-v [-ea]

Running clients: TPCB needs MP% argument, but TPCC does not

To run TPCB client with 15% MP:
Single host
bash run_tpcb1.sh spot client 15 > client.log    (space needed between 5 and >)
or, for enabled asserts
bash run_tpcb1.sh spot client-ea 15 > client.log 

Multiple (2 here) server hosts, client on one host:
bash run_tpcb2.sh spot client 15 > client.log   (space needed between 5 and >)
With replication:
bash run_tpcb2k1.sh spot client 15 > ...

TPC-C: run_tpcc1.sh for single host, like run_tpcb1.sh
--but no MP_PERCENT arg as yet
With replication:
bash run_tpcc2k1.sh spot client > ...
